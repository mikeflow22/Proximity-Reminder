# Proximity-Reminder
TreeHouse Exam Project
Create an iOS app that provides location-specific reminders: 
have your phone remind you to pick up milk when you enter the market, 
or remind you to lock the door when you leave your house. 
Use Core Data to save the reminders and Core Location for geo-fencing and reminder notifications.
